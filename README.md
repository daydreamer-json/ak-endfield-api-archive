Monitor changes to responses from various Arknights: Endfield APIs and record them in this repository.

Updates are checked about every 10 minutes and automatically pushed by GitHub Actions.

The APIs currently being monitored are as follows:
- Launcher
  - Get latest game (Global, China)
  - Get latest game resources (Global, China)
  - Get latest launcher (Global, China)
- Raw
  - Game resource json (index, patch)

Currently, raw data is provided as-is without modification. It is also not decrypted.

## Contributing

Since I can only run the game on platforms and operating systems that are available to me, there may be inaccuracies. If you have information -particularly regarding **Chinese regional game data**, beta versions, encrypted binaries such as `index_main.json` or `game_files`- or if you're able to help improve the code, or if you encounter any other issues, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

All files within the `output` folder are automatically generated by the `src` scripts. Therefore, to make changes, you must modify the scripts themselves.
