## Contributing

Since I can only run the game on platforms and operating systems that are available to me, there may be inaccuracies. If you have information -particularly regarding **Chinese regional game data**, beta versions, encrypted binaries such as `game_files` or `package_files`- or if you're able to help improve the code, or if you encounter any other issues, feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

All files within the `output` folder are automatically generated by the `src` scripts. Therefore, to make changes, you must modify the scripts themselves.
