## Contributing

I run games on the operating systems I own and create archives based on that. If you find any missing resources or other issues, feel free to submit an Issue or Pull Request.

All files within the `output` folder are automatically generated by the `src` scripts. Therefore, to make changes, you must modify the scripts themselves.
